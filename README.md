🚀 Features
Real-time tweet fetching using Twitter API

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Sentiment labeling using a labeled dataset

Sentiment prediction using Linear Regression

Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

Data visualization with charts for sentiment distribution

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning)

Streamlit (for frontend dashboard)

Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

📊 How It Works
Tweets are collected from Twitter API or loaded from a dataset.

Tweets undergo NLP preprocessing: lowercasing, removing URLs/usernames, etc.

Sentiment labels are predicted using a trained Linear Regression model.

Sentiment results are displayed in a Streamlit web app with graphs and filters.
